## Welcome to Simple DMW API

DMW = Document Workflow Management

As you know, there are many API frameworks out there and we can't just keep using everything. So I decided to create my own API boilerplate on top of the KoaJS from scratch in order to keep maintain the scalability, security, robust, know where to go...etc. Of course, this boilerplate doesn't created all by my own. I have been researched, testing, looking for the trade-off, changing, make sure everything is work as my expectation.

Until now, I have implemented many projects base on this boilerplate for my from small to large clients. To be proof everything is work, I have take a small parts from my previous project base on current boilerplate to show you guys.
